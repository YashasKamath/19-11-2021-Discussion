1. The logic is to sort the stores array and then lower bound and the value previous to it in the array are compared and then closest value is pushed into the result array.

2. The logic is that we find the frequency of all booked hotel rooms and then display result by comparing the strings if they have same freq of bookings and displaying the string
with lesser ASCII value (lexicographical order).
